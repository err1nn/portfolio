## PART I - PROPOSAL
Being internationally recognized as a leader in LGBT rights, Taiwan is the first in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. However, many may be surprised by the referendum results rejecting marriage equality in 2018, in which around 70% voting against same-sex marriage. The project will be focusing on Taiwan's journey to same-sex marriage equality, and how Taiwanese stood up from the setback and made love and equality prevail.

### Project Outline
The story will be structured in chronological order, where there are three main components: (1) LGBT History in Taiwan, (2) Taiwanese Referendum 2018, and (3) Same-sex marriage legalization in 2019.

As a hook to grab the audience's attention from the first sentence, I plan to share a recent headline that Taiwan wins the bid over Washington D.C. to host 2025 World Pride Parade, showing the love and equality prevailing in the country.

#### ▍LGBT History in Taiwan
I plan to start by briefly going through the LGBT history in Taiwan. The concise but informative timeline can serve as the background knowledge of the governmental and civic activities related to LGBTQ rights. I have yet to identified the best approach to present the data, but right now I will put them in a timeline format.

#### ▍Taiwanese Referendum 2018
As the story goes on, the readers will be entering the "lowest ebb" of the story. I will not only show how the anti-LGBT organizations was trying to destory the human rights but show how frustrating the referendum result was. 

I plan to develop a Tableau dashboard that the audience can have interative experience when reviewing the referendum result. The dashboard would be composed of an arc chart showing the composition of the voting result, and a choropleth graph showing the percentage of "Yes" votes by city in Taiwan.

#### ▍Same-sex marriage legalization in 2019
Finally, the story will end with a happy news, the same-sex marriage legalization in Taiwan. Aside from the narrative story, I will also use a gridplot to highlight that Taiwan is the first in Asia that legalizes same-sex marriage.

(Disclaimer: All data shown in the sketches is not accucurate as they are only the preliminary sketches used to show the concepts for the future visualizations.)

I hope to share the joy and freedom in Taiwan with the readers, and inform the readers that it has been a long journey for Taiwan to achieve the equality. Even if you haven't seen the green light on LGBTQ rights in your country, never give up on advocating for the gender equity.

### Data Sources
There are 4 tentative data sources that I will plan to use for visualzations. #1 and #2 are web data; #3 can be found at the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HOwIGbMwNg8rr7Q6aCOx4kcbOdWwUrnT?usp=sharing).

1. **Timeline of LGBT History in Taiwan** (_Source: [Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/LGBT_history_in_Taiwan#/Timeline_of_LGBT_history_in_the_Republic_Of_China_/_Taiwan)_)<br>
The data will be used as an overview of the LGBT history in Taiwan, illustrating both governmental and civic activities.

2. **LGBT Rights in Taiwan** (_Source: [EQUALDEX](https://www.equaldex.com/region/taiwan)_)<br>
The data will be used as a piece of supplementary information of the LGBT history in Taiwan. I plan to use some of the numbers to create infographics that can show the audience more interesting insights.

3. **2018 Referendum Results** (_Source: [Central Election Commision in Taiwan](https://data.gov.tw/en/datasets/all)_)<br>
The data will be used to show the results that a majority of the voters rejected same-sex marriage and the implementation of LGBT-inclusive education.

4. **Countries where Same-Sex Marriage is Legal** (_Source: [Good Morning America](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/29-countries-sex-marriage-officially-legal-56041136)_)<br>
The data will be used to highlight that Taiwan is the first and only country that legalizes same-sex marriage in Asia.


### Method and Medium
The final deliverable will be presented using **Shorthand**, a digital storytelling platform. All data visualizations will be created using **Tableau**, **Flourish**, or **PlotDB**, whichever fits the best.
