## PART I - PROPOSAL
Being internationally recognized as a leader in LGBTQ rights, Taiwan is the first in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. However, many may be surprised by the referendum results rejecting marriage equality in 2018, in which around 70% voted against same-sex marriage. The project will be focusing on Taiwan's journey to same-sex marriage equality, and how Taiwanese stood up from the setback and made love and equality prevail.

### Project Outline
The story will be structured in chronological order, where there are three main components: (1) LGBTQ History in Taiwan, (2) Taiwanese Referendum 2018, and (3) Same-sex marriage legalization in 2019.

As a hook to grab the audience's attention from the first sentence, I plan to share a recent headline that Taiwan wins the bid over Washington D.C. to host the 2025 World Pride Parade, showing the love and equality prevailing in the country.

#### ▍LGBTQ History in Taiwan
I plan to start by briefly going through the LGBTQ history in Taiwan. The concise but informative timeline can serve as the background knowledge of the governmental and civic activities related to LGBTQ rights. I have yet to identify the best approach to present the data, so I will put them in a timeline format now.

#### ▍Taiwanese Referendum 2018
As the story goes on, the readers will be entering the "lowest ebb" of the story. I will not only show how the anti-LGBTQ organizations were trying to destroy human rights but show how frustrating the referendum result was. 

I plan to develop a Tableau dashboard that the audience can have an interactive experience when reviewing the referendum result. The dashboard would be composed of an arc chart showing the composition of the voting result, and a choropleth graph showing the percentage of "Yes" votes by the city in Taiwan.

#### ▍Same-sex marriage legalization in 2019
Finally, the story will end with happy news, the same-sex marriage legalization in Taiwan. Aside from the narrative story, I will also use a grid plot to highlight that Taiwan is the first in Asia that legalizes same-sex marriage.

I hope to share the joy and freedom in Taiwan with the readers, and inform the readers that it has been a long journey for Taiwan to achieve equality. Even if you haven't seen the green light on LGBTQ rights in your country, never give up on advocating for gender equity.

### Data Sources
There are 4 tentative data sources that I will plan to use for visualizations. #1, #2 and #4 are web data; #3 can be found at the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HOwIGbMwNg8rr7Q6aCOx4kcbOdWwUrnT?usp=sharing).

1. **Timeline of LGBTQ History in Taiwan** (_Source: [Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/LGBT_history_in_Taiwan#/Timeline_of_LGBT_history_in_the_Republic_Of_China_/_Taiwan)_)<br>
The data will be used as an overview of the LGBTQ history in Taiwan, illustrating both governmental and civic activities.

2. **LGBTQ Rights in Taiwan** (_Source: [EQUALDEX](https://www.equaldex.com/region/taiwan)_)<br>
The data will be used as a piece of supplementary information on the LGBTQ history in Taiwan. I plan to use some of the numbers to create infographics that can show the audience more interesting insights.

3. **2018 Referendum Results** (_Source: [Central Election Commision in Taiwan](https://data.gov.tw/en/datasets/all)_)<br>
The data will be used to show the results that a majority of the voters rejected same-sex marriage and the implementation of LGBTQ-inclusive education.

4. **Countries where Same-Sex Marriage is Legal** (_Source: [Good Morning America](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/29-countries-sex-marriage-officially-legal-56041136)_)<br>
The data will be used to highlight that Taiwan is the first and only country that legalizes same-sex marriage in Asia.

### Method and Medium
As a next step after the initial proposal, I plan to develop wireframes and storyboards. I will also conduct a series of **user interviews** to collect iterative feedback for both wireframes and future visualizations.

The final deliverable will be presented using **Shorthand**, a digital storytelling platform. I plan to tell the story using narration along with the supporting data visualizations. All data visualizations will be created using **Tableau**, **Flourish**, or **PlotDB**, whichever fits the best.

## PART II - WIREFRAMES, STORYBOARDS AND USER RESEARCH
In part II of my final project, I continued constructing and refining the narrative that will take the reader on the journey through my story. Built on the initial proposal, I developed the wireframes and storyboards and conducted user interviews with three potential target individuals of my story.

### Storyboards with Wireframes
I divided the story into the following five parts:
1. Hook: Taiwan to host 2025 World Pride
2. LGBTQ History in Taiwan
3. Taiwanese Referendum 2018
4. Same-sex marriage legalization in 2019 and its influence on LGBTQ rights in Asia
5. Call to action: Be yourself whenever you're ready

The storyboards I used for user research can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KiWlYqv5HKvaCmZnrekHWWe4TNcTmZMo/view?usp=sharing).

### User Research Protocal

#### ▍Target audience
The target audience for my story is the LGBTQ community, their friends and family, and people who support LGBTQ. More specifically, I wish to use the story to reach out to the LGBTQ community in Asia, who are fearful, discomfort with, or mistrust of themselves being lesbian, gay, or bisexual. In Asia, LGBTQ rights are relatively limited in comparison to other areas of the world. I wish my story to stand to encourage their self-acceptance and let them know there is always support when they are ready to be themselves.

#### ▍Approach to Identify Represenntative Individuals
Luckily, I graduated from a university where LGBTQ is widely accepted. I've made a few good friends who are LGBTQ themselves, or have a friend or family member who is LGBTQ. I interviewed three of them:
1. A bisexual who is studying in law school now; female, mid-20s
2. A LGBTQ supporter who is studying in policy school now; female, mid-20s
3. A PhD student who has a close gay friend; male, mid-20s

I hope to learn from the interviews to find out what interests them to read and what does not, and if the story is logically and clearly presented. I also want to obtain feedback on if there's any information they expect to see in the story but I failed to include. Based on the questions listed below, I will make changes to imporve my story and data visualizations.

### User Interviews and Findings

The interview questions and direct quotes from the interviews are documented in the table below.

Questions|Interviewee 1|Interviewee 2|Interviewee 3
---|---|---|---
Are you aware of the topic before you read the story? Do you find anything new to you from the story?|Yes. __The approval rate by district and demographics__ is new to me.|Yes. __The influence of Taiwan's same-sex marriage legalization on other countries in Asia__ would be new to me.|Yes. __World Pride 2025__ and the __demographics scatter plots__ are new to me.
What do you think the purpose of the story is?|To show the __progress of LGBTQ rights in Taiwan__, and try to influence other countries/encourage LGBTQ individuals in other countries.|To __show support for LGBTQ community__, making them feel comfortable with being themselves.|To __advertise Taiwan is hosting World Pride 2025__
Do you feel the story is clear in terms of the order of the contents? If not, what makes you feel confused with?|I think it’s clear.|I am confused with the labels/units for x- and y-axis of the scatter plots?|Yes, pretty clear.
Do the visualizations make sense to you? Do you feel they are aligned with the storyline?|Yes.|Yes.|Yes. I like the scatter plots, giving me much new information.
Is there anything missing but you expected to see in the story?|The __agree and disagree in non-government organization.__|Would like to see more discussion on __how NPOs are showing support for LGBTQ rights__, __what triggers people to turn their minds?__|No, I think the content is complete for me.
Is there anything you want to add, delete, and/or change?|The explanation of __why Same-sex marriage can still be legalized while the referendum was vetoed__. (Or is it included in “How did Taiwan overcome the backlash and……” part?)|I'd start the LGBTQ history timeline with the first "rejection" of marriage registration. This should be a strong start to tell the rest of the story (timeline). And I feel in the section of legalization in 2019, I'd want to see more on __who is actually supporting LGBTQ__ in comparison to what you have in the previous section (who rejected same-sex marriage).|The color scheme of all visualizations can be consitent.

#### ▍Changes Based on User Feedback
I plan to make the following changes in response to the interview findings.
- Change 1
- Change 2
