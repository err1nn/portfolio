# Final Project

## PART I: PROPOSAL

### Project Outline
#### Summary
Being internationally recognized as a leader in LGBT rights, Taiwan is the first in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. In a recent headline, Taiwan has been chosen to host World Pride Parade in 2025. However, many may be surprised by the referendum results rejecting marriage equality in 2018, in which around 70 percent voting against same-sex marriage. The project will be focusing on Taiwan's journey to same-sex marriage equality, and how Taiwanese stood up from the setback and made love and equality prevail.
