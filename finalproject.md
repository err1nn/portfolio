# Final Project
🇹🇼🏳️‍🌈🇹🇼🏳️‍🌈🇹🇼

## PART I - PROPOSAL
Being internationally recognized as a leader in LGBT rights, Taiwan is the first in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. However, many may be surprised by the referendum results rejecting marriage equality in 2018, in which around 70 percent voting against same-sex marriage. The project will be focusing on Taiwan's journey to same-sex marriage equality, and how Taiwanese stood up from the setback and made love and equality prevail.

### Project Outline
#### Story Structure
The story will be structured in chronological order, where there are three main components: (1) LGBT History in Taiwan, (2) Taiwanese Referendum 2018, and (3) Same-sex marriage legalization in 2019.

As a hook to grab the audience's attention from the first sentence, I plan to share a recent headline that Taiwan wins the bid over Washington D.C. to host 2025 World Pride Parade.

I plan to start by briefly going through the LGBT history in Taiwan. The timeline can show an overview of the

### Data Sources
There are 4 tentative data sources that I will plan to use for visualzations. #1 and #4 are web data; #2 and #3 can be found at the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HOwIGbMwNg8rr7Q6aCOx4kcbOdWwUrnT?usp=sharing).

### Method and Medium
The final deliverable will be presented using Shorthand, a digital storytelling platform. All data visualizations will be created using Tableau, Flourish, or PlotDB, whichever fits the best. 

The project intends to use data visualizations to inform the readers the warm story: Taiwan's journey to same-sex marriage. As already noted above, I plan to start the project with a hook that Taiwan is to host 2025 World Pride, showing the love and equality prevailing in the country. The readers will then be showcased a concise but informative timeline of the LGBT history in Taiwan. I have yet to identified the best approach to present the data. As the story goes on, the readers will be entering the "lowest ebb" of the story. I will not only show how the anti-LGBT organizations was trying to destory the human rights but show how frustrating the referendum result was. Finally, the story will end with a happy news, the same-sex marriage legalization in Taiwan.
