# Final Project

## PART I: PROPOSAL

### Project Outline
#### Summary
Being internationally recognized as a leader in LGBT rights, Taiwan is the first in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. However, many may be surprised by the referendum results rejecting marriage equality in 2018, in which around 70 percent voting against same-sex marriage. The project will be focusing on Taiwan's journey to same-sex marriage equality, and how Taiwanese stood up from the setback and made love and equality prevail.

#### Story Structure
The story will be structured in chronological order, where there are three main components: (1) LGBT History in Taiwan, (2) Taiwanese Referendum 2018, and (3) Same-sex marriage legalization in 2019.
