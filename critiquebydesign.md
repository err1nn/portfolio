In this assignment, I utilized the knowledge I learned from [Design and Redesign in Data Visualization](https://medium.com/@hint_fm/design-and-redesign-4ab77206cf9): chose a public data visualization, critiqued the visualization, wireframed a solution using Balsamiq, conducted user innterviews to test the solution, and built the final solution using Flourish.

## Step 1 - Find a Data Visualization
I selected the Formula 1 United States Grand Prix 2021 Race Lap Chart that exemplify the positions of each driver on every lap.

## Step 2 - Critique the Data Visualization
I critiqued the data visualization using the criteria introduced in [Data Visualization Effectivenness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) by Stephen Few.

| Criteria       | Score         | Description                                                           |
| -------------  | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Usefulness     | 7             | Useless vs. Very useful                                               |
| Completeness   | 7             | No relevant data vs. All relevant data                                |
| Perceptibility | 4             | Unclear and diffucult vs. Clear and easy                              |
| Truthfulness   | 10            | Innaccurate and invalid vs. Accurate and valid                        |
| Intuitiveness  | 4             | Unfamiliar; difficult to understand vs. Familiar; easy to understand  |
| Aesthetics     | 3             | Ugly vs. Pleasing to the eye                                          |
| Engagement     | 8             | Distracts from data vs. Draws one into the data                       |


Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here. What stood out to you? What did you find worked really well? What didn't? What, if anything, would you do differently?

Who is the primary audience for this tool? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience? Why or why not?

Final thoughts: how successful was this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here? What would you change? Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)



## Step 3 - Wireframe the Visualization


## Step 4 - Test the Solution


## Step 5 - Build the Solution
