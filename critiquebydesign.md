In this assignment, I utilized the knowledge I learned from [Design and Redesign in Data Visualization](https://medium.com/@hint_fm/design-and-redesign-4ab77206cf9): chose a public data visualization, critiqued the visualization, wireframed a solution using Balsamiq, conducted user innterviews for testing the solution, and built the final solution using Tableau.

## Step 1 - Find a Data Visualization
I selected two data visualizations that exemplify the highest paid occupations in the United States. The data used in the visualization are collected from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
