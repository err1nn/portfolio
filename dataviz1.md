# Data Visualization: Visualizing Government Debt
October 31, 2021

## I. Working with Web-Based Visualization Tools and Data
General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.

## II. OECD Government Debt: The Debt-to-GDP Ratio

The grid of line charts let us visualize the Debt-to-GDP ratio across a number of countries and years. This method is akin to [sparklines](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR), which we can easily present the data that need to move within complex multivariate spaces.
