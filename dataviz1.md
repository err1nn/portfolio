October 31, 2021

## Part 1: Working with Web-Based Visualization Tools and Data
General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits. [(Source: OECD Data: General government debt)]((https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm)
