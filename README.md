Hi! üëã This is Erin's portfolio for 94-870 Telling Stories with Data at CMU Heinz College! üêï‚Äçü¶∫

## About Me
Erin is a second-year MS Public Policy and Management student at Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. Prior to graduate studies, she had experience in Product Management at a global leading streaming service.

She works as a research assistant in operations research and its applications in supply chain resilience and transportation fairness. This past summer, she worked on a research project, which is on the topic of design and implementation of network models to help improve supply chain resiliency. The project goal is aligned with her interests in decision analytics and sustainability. She conducted literature reviews and data analytics for on-demand markets, and prepare visualizations for future product and project reports.

Her passion for solving problems that live at the nexus of people, policy, and technology brought her to CMU Heinz to prepare her for an Strategy/Operations Analyst role in response to disruptions and uncertainty. She embraces her differentiators and is ready to work with significant real-world problem-solving under her belt.

## What I Hope to Learn
With the coding ability in buckets, I hope to learn a more design-oriented perspective to data visualization that I can add another level on my work. I look forward to being a data enthusiast who can understand clients' data visualization needs and leverage the design mindset to develop creative, informational visualizations.
